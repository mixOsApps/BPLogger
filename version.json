  "releaseNotes": "v1.4.0 — Camera Import Feature Overhaul\n\n📸 What's New\n• Camera Import for printed/typed BP records — Capture blood pressure records from printed documents or typed spreadsheets using your phone camera\n• Smart OCR parsing — Automatically detects and separates Date (MMdd), Time (HHmm), Systolic/Diastolic readings, and Pulse from captured text\n• Date inheritance — Lines without a date automatically inherit the date from the previous record (common in grouped daily readings)\n• Year selection prompt — After capture, select the year for the entire batch of records in one step\n• Editable review screen — Review and edit all captured records before saving, with per-row remove (X) button\n• Batch save — Save all captured records at once with validation and progress indicator\n• Camera permission handling — Improved permission flow with retry button if denied\n\n🐛 Bug Fixes\n• Fixed camera crash caused by null URI from ImageCapture\n• Fixed FileProvider not serving cache directory files\n• Added temp file cleanup after OCR processing\n\n⚠️ Known Limitations\n• Handwritten records are not supported — On-device ML Kit text recognition works reliably only with printed or typed text\n• OCR accuracy depends on image quality — Ensure good lighting, steady capture, and clear printed text for best results\n\n🛠 Technical Notes\n• Source type for camera-imported records is tagged as \"ocr\" in the database\n• OCR uses ML Kit on-device text recognition (no internet required)\n• Bounding box coordinate analysis used for tabular data reconstruction\n\n——————————————\n\nv1.3.0 — Restore from Google Sheet\n\n• Added \"Restore from Google Sheet\" feature in Settings\n• Pull synced records from Google Sheet back into the app\n• Smart duplicate detection — skips records already in the local database\n• Inline progress updates showing each restore step\n• Confirmation dialog before restore begins\n• Summary showing new records added vs. skipped\n• Updated Apps Script to support full record data retrieval\n• Removed \"Backup & Restore\" from Coming Soon (now implemented)\n\n——————————————\n\nVersion 1.2.0 — UX Improvements and Bug Fixes\nThis release focuses on improving the user experience and fixing several bugs related to data syncing and app updates.\n\n✨ Features & UX Improvements:\n• Swipe-to-Delete Rework (HomeScreen): Swiping a record no longer deletes it instantly. Instead, it now reveals a \"Delete\" button, requiring an explicit tap to confirm deletion.\n• Longer Undo Delay (HomeScreen): The \"Undo\" message after deleting a record now stays on screen for 10 seconds, giving more time to restore a deleted record.\n\n🐛 Bug Fixes:\n• Prevents Duplicate Syncing (SyncStatusManager): The app now checks for existing records in your Google Sheet before syncing to prevent duplicates.\n• Improved Update Checking (AppUpdateManager): Disabled HTTP cache for update checks to ensure the latest version is always detected.",
